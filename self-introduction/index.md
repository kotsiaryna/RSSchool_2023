Hi! My name is Katherine and I’m  a Frontend Developer.

I live in Brest, Belarus. Here I graduated from Brest State Technical University as an economist. And I have been working as an economist and an accountant during the last years .

One day I stopped and asked myself “ Katherine, is this the work of your dream? Is this really how you want to spend all your life?”  -  “Oh no! I want much more”. And then I decided to change my life radically and to become a fronend developer and began studying HTML, CSS and JS.

My way was rather long and hard. My first attempt was in June 2021. A good friend of mine advised me to try RS School, and I tried, but failed even Stage 0. But I didn’t give up, and made one more attempt half a year later, and that time I succeeded and finished Stage 0 and Stage 1. But there were circumstances that I had to take a break from studying.

And now here I am, back again, ready to go further and reach my goal -  to get to the end, finish Stage 2 and React course and find the job of my dream. 
I realize that in the current situation it’s difficult and close to impossible to find a good job in Belarus, but in half a year I see myself as a working frontend developer. I have already done a lot, and I’m not going to give up.

My soft skills help me a lot on this way. I’m rather good at time-management. I have learnt to combine my studies and  job, and also have time for my family and hobbies. Persistence and sense of purpose help me not to give up. I train mindfulness and attention to details while coding and debugging. I’m adaptable and open to learning new technologies. I’m good at solving problems myself, but also have good experience of command work. I believe that everything is possible, if you really want it. 
 
During my education I opened a new world, and it is really great. Now I understand that for a developer it is possible to create everything, you should only choose the right tools.I’m interested in new technologies and modern trends and try to apply them in my projects.
I met new people here, they are keen and open-minded, and ready to help you when it’s necessary. And it’s also great and adds me some more motivation on my way. 


I want to say great thanks to Rolling Scopes School and this opportunity to learn, practice, communicate and finally become a really cool frontend developer.
